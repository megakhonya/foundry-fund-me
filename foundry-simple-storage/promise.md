Meg:
- encrypt key with a keystore & password
- remove history
- I WILL BE SAFE

1. For the moment, a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` file is cool; so long as I don't expose the `.env` file.
2. But for real money, I won't do that. I will use `--interactive` or a keystore file with a password once foundry adds that.
